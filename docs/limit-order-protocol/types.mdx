| :------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Suitable for                                | Traders                                                                                                                                                 | Market Makers                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Flexibility of adding features to the order | More, including features like Order execution predicate and Callback, more details [here](/docs/limit-order-protocol/introduction#limit-order-features) | Comparatively less, as these orders need to be highly Gas Optimised. Features like expiration time, partial filling(once) and more are available, more details [here](/docs/limit-order-protocol/introduction#rfq-order-features) |
| Execution of the Order                      | The Pathfinder algorithm uses the orders as a source of liquidity to match with incoming orders.                                                        | The orders are exposed via API and later a Trader or the platform asks for the quotes to match.                                                                                                                                   |
